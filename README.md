# OperatorMonotoneCorrelationTools

A package for computing quantities induced by operator monotone functions as detailed in the soon-to-exist arXiv paper. 

## Numerical Experiments
The numerical experiments explore the numerical instability of the current algorithms. They are designed to be run on a REPL for Julia; they have been verified to work using the Julia REPL on VSCode.

## Documentation
All implemented functions have [corresponding documentation](https://qit-george.github.io/OperatorMonotoneCorrelationTools/dev/)
